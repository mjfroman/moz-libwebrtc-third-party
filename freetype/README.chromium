Description:
This package tracks upstream FreeType. It is shipped as part of Chrome on all
platforms. FreeType is needed on Windows and Mac for PDFium as well for enabling
font format support for OpenType Variations on older OS versions.

How to update:
1. Find the desired commit in
   https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/third_party/freetype2/ .
   If such a commit does not yet exist, branch from the appropriate point with
   a branch name like "chromium/android/VER-X-X-X-updates" depending on the
   FreeType tag being branched and commit changes there.
2. Update BUILD.gn to reflect any changes.
3. Merge the new src/include/freetype/config/ftoption.h into
   include/freetype-custom-config/ftoption.h .
4. Merge the new src/include/freetype/config/ftconfig.h into
   include/freetype-custom-config/ftconfig.h .
5. Update this file.
6. Commit build changes while rolling Chromium's freetype DEPS to the
   new commit.

Most of the updating can be automated will roll-freetype.sh.
