This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS Clicking outside a popover will dismiss the popover
PASS Canceling pointer events should not keep clicks from light dismissing popovers
PASS Clicking inside a popover does not close that popover
FAIL Popovers close on pointerup, not pointerdown promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "ReferenceError: actions is not defined"
FAIL Synthetic events can't close popovers assert_false: expected false got true
PASS Moving focus outside the popover should not dismiss the popover
PASS Clicking inside a child popover shouldn't close either popover
PASS Clicking inside a parent popover should close child popover
PASS Clicking on invoking element, after using it for activation, shouldn't close its popover
PASS Clicking on invoking element, after using it for activation, shouldn't close its popover (nested case)
PASS Clicking on invoking element, after using it for activation, shouldn't close its popover (nested case, not used for invocation)
PASS Clicking on invoking element, even if it wasn't used for activation, shouldn't close its popover
PASS Clicking on popovertarget element, even if it wasn't used for activation, should hide it exactly once
PASS Clicking on anchor element (that isn't an invoking element) shouldn't prevent its popover from being closed
PASS Dragging from an open popover outside an open popover should leave the popover open
PASS A popover inside an invoking element doesn't participate in that invoker's ancestor chain
PASS An invoking element that was not used to invoke the popover is not part of the ancestor chain
PASS Scrolling within a popover should not close the popover
PASS Clicking inside a shadow DOM popover does not close that popover
PASS Clicking outside a shadow DOM popover should close that popover
PASS Moving focus back to the anchor element should not dismiss the popover
PASS Ensure circular/convoluted ancestral relationships are functional
PASS Ensure circular/convoluted ancestral relationships are functional, with a direct showPopover()
PASS Hide the target popover during "hide all popovers until"
PASS Show a sibling popover during "hide all popovers until"
PASS Show an unrelated popover during "hide popover"
Harness: the test ran to completion.
