This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS Passing no bitrate config results in defaults
FAIL Passing bitsPerSecond:0 results in targets close to 0 assert_approx_equals: expected 0 +/- 100000 but got 106000
FAIL Passing only audioBitsPerSecond:0 results in 0 for audio, default for video assert_equals: expected 0 but got 6000
FAIL Passing only videoBitsPerSecond:0 results in 0 for video, default for audio assert_equals: expected 0 but got 100000
FAIL Passing bitsPerSecond:0 overrides audio/video-specific values assert_approx_equals: expected 0 +/- 100000 but got 106000
PASS Passing bitsPerSecond overrides audio/video zero values
PASS Passing bitsPerSecond sets audio/video bitrate values
PASS Passing only audioBitsPerSecond results in default for video
PASS Passing only videoBitsPerSecond results in default for audio
FAIL Passing videoBitsPerSecond for audio-only stream still results in something for video assert_equals: expected 1000000 but got 2500000
FAIL Passing audioBitsPerSecond for video-only stream still results in something for audio assert_equals: expected 100000 but got 128000
PASS Passing bitsPerSecond for audio-only stream still results in something for video
PASS Passing bitsPerSecond for video-only stream still results in something for audio
PASS Selected default track bitrates are not changed by start()
PASS Passed-in track bitrates are not changed by start()
PASS Passing bitsPerSecond for audio/video stream does not change track bitrates in start()
FAIL Passing bitsPerSecond for audio stream sets video track bitrate to 0 in start() assert_approx_equals: expected 500000 +/- 100000 but got 128000
FAIL Passing bitsPerSecond for video stream sets audio track bitrate to 0 in start() assert_equals: expected 0 but got 128000
Harness: the test ran to completion.
