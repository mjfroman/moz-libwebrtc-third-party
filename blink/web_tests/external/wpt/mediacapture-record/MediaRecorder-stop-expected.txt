This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS MediaRecorder will stop recording and fire a stop event when all tracks are ended
PASS MediaRecorder will stop recording and fire a stop event when stop() is called
PASS MediaRecorder will not fire an exception when stopped after creation
PASS MediaRecorder will not fire an exception when stopped after having just been stopped
PASS MediaRecorder will not fire an exception when stopped after having just been spontaneously stopped
FAIL MediaRecorder will fire start event even if stopped synchronously assert_array_equals: lengths differ, expected array ["start", "stop"] length 2, got ["stop"] length 1
FAIL MediaRecorder will fire start event even if a track is removed synchronously assert_array_equals: lengths differ, expected array ["start", "error", "data", "stop"] length 4, got [] length 0
Harness: the test ran to completion.
