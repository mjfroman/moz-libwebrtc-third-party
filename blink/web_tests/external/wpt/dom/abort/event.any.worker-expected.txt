This is a testharness.js-based test.
FAIL AbortController abort() should fire event synchronously assert_true: signal has reason property expected true got false
PASS controller.signal should always return the same object
PASS controller.abort() should do nothing the second time it is called
PASS event handler should not be called if added after controller.abort()
PASS the abort event should have the right properties
FAIL AbortController abort(reason) should set signal.reason assert_true: signal has reason property expected true got false
FAIL aborting AbortController without reason creates an "AbortError" DOMException assert_true: signal has reason property expected true got false
FAIL AbortController abort(undefined) creates an "AbortError" DOMException assert_true: signal has reason property expected true got false
FAIL static aborting signal should have right properties assert_true: signal.reason is DOMException expected true got false
FAIL static aborting signal with reason should set signal.reason assert_equals: signal.reason expected (object) object "Error: hello" but got (undefined) undefined
Harness: the test ran to completion.
