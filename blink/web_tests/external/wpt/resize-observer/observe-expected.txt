This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS ResizeObserver implemented
PASS guard
PASS test0: simple observation
PASS test1: multiple observation on same element trigger only one
PASS test2: throw exception when observing non-element
PASS test3: disconnect stops all notifications
PASS test4: unobserve target stops notifications, unobserve non-observed does nothing
PASS test5: observe img
PASS test6: iframe notifications
PASS test7: callback.this
PASS test8: simple content-box observation
FAIL test9: simple content-box observation but keep border-box size unchanged assert_unreached: Timed out waiting for notification. (100ms) Reached unreachable code
PASS test10: simple border-box observation
PASS test11: simple observation with vertical writing mode
FAIL test12: no observation is fired after the change of writing mode when box's specified size comes from logical size properties. assert_unreached: the logical size of content-box doesn't change Reached unreachable code
FAIL test13: an observation is fired after the change of writing mode when box's specified size comes from physical size properties. assert_unreached: Timed out waiting for notification. (100ms) Reached unreachable code
PASS test14: observe the same target but using a different box should override the previous one
PASS test15: an observation is fired with box dimensions 0 when element's display property is set to inline
PASS test16: observations do not fire for non-replaced inline elements
Harness: the test ran to completion.
