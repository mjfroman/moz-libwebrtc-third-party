This is a testharness.js-based test.
FAIL Setting a null effect on a running animation fires an animationend event assert_true: Timed out waiting for animationend expected true got false
PASS Replacing an animation's effect with an effect that targets a different property should update both properties
PASS Replacing an animation's effect with a shorter one that should have already finished, the animation finishes immediately
PASS A play-pending animation's effect whose effect is replaced still exits the pending state
FAIL CSS animation events are dispatched at the original element even after setting an effect with a different target element assert_true: Timed out waiting for animationstart expected true got false
FAIL After replacing a finished animation's effect with a longer one it fires an animationstart event assert_true: Timed out waiting for animationstart expected true got false
PASS Replacing the effect of a CSSAnimation causes subsequent changes to corresponding animation-* properties to be ignored
Harness: the test ran to completion.
