This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS play() overrides animation-play-state
PASS play() does NOT override the animation-play-state if there was an error
PASS pause() overrides animation-play-state
FAIL reverse() overrides animation-play-state when it starts playing the animation assert_equals: Should still be running even after flipping the animation-play-state expected "running" but got "paused"
PASS reverse() does NOT override animation-play-state if the animation is already running
FAIL Setting the startTime to null overrides animation-play-state if the animation is already running assert_equals: Should still be paused even after flipping the animation-play-state expected "paused" but got "running"
FAIL Setting the startTime to non-null overrides animation-play-state if the animation is paused assert_equals: Should still be running even after flipping the animation-play-state expected "running" but got "paused"
PASS Setting the startTime to non-null does NOT override the animation-play-state if the animation is already running
FAIL Setting the current time completes a pending pause assert_true: Animation is pause-pending expected true got false
Harness: the test ran to completion.
