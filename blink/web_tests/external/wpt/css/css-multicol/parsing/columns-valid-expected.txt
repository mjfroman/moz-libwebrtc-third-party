This is a testharness.js-based test.
FAIL e.style['columns'] = "auto 3" should set the property value assert_equals: serialization should be canonical expected "3" but got "auto 3"
FAIL e.style['columns'] = "auto 10em" should set the property value assert_equals: serialization should be canonical expected "10em" but got "10em auto"
FAIL e.style['columns'] = "3 auto" should set the property value assert_equals: serialization should be canonical expected "3" but got "auto 3"
FAIL e.style['columns'] = "10em auto" should set the property value assert_equals: serialization should be canonical expected "10em" but got "10em auto"
PASS e.style['columns'] = "2 10px" should set the property value
PASS e.style['columns'] = "10px 2" should set the property value
FAIL e.style['columns'] = "auto" should set the property value assert_equals: serialization should be canonical expected "auto" but got "auto auto"
FAIL e.style['columns'] = "auto auto" should set the property value assert_equals: serialization should be canonical expected "auto" but got "auto auto"
FAIL e.style['columns'] = "7" should set the property value assert_equals: serialization should be canonical expected "7" but got "auto 7"
FAIL e.style['columns'] = "7em" should set the property value assert_equals: serialization should be canonical expected "7em" but got "7em auto"
PASS e.style['columns'] = "0 1" should set the property value
PASS e.style['columns'] = "1 0" should set the property value
PASS e.style['columns'] = "0px 1" should set the property value
PASS e.style['columns'] = "initial" should set the property value
