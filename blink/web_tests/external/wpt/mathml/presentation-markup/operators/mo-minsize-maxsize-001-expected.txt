This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS minsize < 0 is treated as 0
FAIL maxsize < minsize is treated as maxsize = minsize assert_approx_equals: expected 175 +/- 1 but got 125
FAIL minsize < maxsize < 0 is treated as maxsize = minsize = 0 assert_less_than: expected a number less than 50 but got 125
FAIL target size = 0 is treated as Tascent = Tdescent = minsize/2 assert_approx_equals: expected 100 +/- 1 but got 25
Harness: the test ran to completion.
