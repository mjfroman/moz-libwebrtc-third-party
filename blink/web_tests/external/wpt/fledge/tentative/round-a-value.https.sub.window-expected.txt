This is a testharness.js-based test.
FAIL Check adCost is stochastically rounded with 8 bit mantissa and exponent. promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "TypeError: navigator.joinAdInterestGroup is not a function"
FAIL Check bid is stochastically rounded with 8 bit mantissa and exponent. promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "TypeError: navigator.joinAdInterestGroup is not a function"
FAIL Check desirability is stochastically rounded with 8 bit mantissa and exponent. promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "TypeError: navigator.joinAdInterestGroup is not a function"
FAIL Check highestScoringOtherBid is stochastically rounded with 8 bit mantissa and exponent. promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "TypeError: navigator.joinAdInterestGroup is not a function"
FAIL Value is ignored as a non-valid floating-point number. promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "TypeError: navigator.joinAdInterestGroup is not a function"
FAIL Value is rounded to 0 if value is greater than 0 and its exponent is less than -128. promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "TypeError: navigator.joinAdInterestGroup is not a function"
FAIL Value is rounded to -0 if value is greater than 0 and its exponent is less than -128. promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "TypeError: navigator.joinAdInterestGroup is not a function"
FAIL Value is rounded to Infinity if value is greater than 0 and its exponent is greater than 127. promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "TypeError: navigator.joinAdInterestGroup is not a function"
FAIL Value is rounded to -Infinity if value is less than 0 and its exponent is greater than 127. promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "TypeError: navigator.joinAdInterestGroup is not a function"
Harness: the test ran to completion.
