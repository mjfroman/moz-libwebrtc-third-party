This is a testharness.js-based test.
FAIL getParameters should return RTCRtpEncodingParameters with all required fields assert_equals: expected 1 but got 0
FAIL addTransceiver(audio) with undefined sendEncodings should have default encoding parameter with active set to true assert_equals: expected 1 but got 0
FAIL addTransceiver(video) with undefined sendEncodings should have default encoding parameter with active set to true and scaleResolutionDownBy set to 1 assert_equals: expected 1 but got 0
FAIL addTransceiver(audio) with empty list sendEncodings should have default encoding parameter with active set to true assert_equals: expected 1 but got 0
FAIL addTransceiver(video) with empty list sendEncodings should have default encoding parameter with active set to true and scaleResolutionDownBy set to 1 assert_equals: expected 1 but got 0
FAIL addTransceiver(video) should auto-set scaleResolutionDownBy to 1 when some encodings have it, but not all assert_equals: expected (number) 1 but got (undefined) undefined
FAIL addTransceiver should auto-set scaleResolutionDownBy to powers of 2 (descending) when absent assert_equals: expected (number) 2 but got (undefined) undefined
PASS addTransceiver with a ridiculous number of encodings should truncate the list
PASS addTransceiver(audio) with multiple encodings should result in one encoding with no properties other than active

FAIL setParameters with scaleResolutionDownBy on an audio sender should succeed, but remove the scaleResolutionDownBy assert_equals: expected 1 but got 0
FAIL setParameters with an invalid scaleResolutionDownBy on an audio sender should succeed, but remove the scaleResolutionDownBy assert_equals: expected 1 but got 0

PASS addTransceiver with rid longer than 255 characters throws TypeError
PASS addTransceiver with scaleResolutionDownBy < 1 throws RangeError
PASS sender.getParameters() should return sendEncodings set by addTransceiver()
FAIL sender.setParameters() with added encodings should reject with InvalidModificationError assert_equals: expected 1 but got 0
PASS sender.setParameters() with removed encodings should reject with InvalidModificationError
PASS sender.setParameters() with reordered encodings should reject with InvalidModificationError
PASS sender.setParameters() with encodings unset should reject with TypeError
PASS setParameters() with modified encoding.rid field should reject with InvalidModificationError
FAIL setParameters() with encoding.scaleResolutionDownBy field set to less than 1.0 should reject with RangeError promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "TypeError: Cannot set properties of undefined (setting 'scaleResolutionDownBy')"
