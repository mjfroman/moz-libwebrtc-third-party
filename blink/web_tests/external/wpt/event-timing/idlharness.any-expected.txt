PASS Partial interface Performance: member names are unique
PASS Partial dictionary PerformanceObserverInit: original dictionary defined
PASS Partial dictionary PerformanceObserverInit: member names are unique
PASS Partial interface Performance[2]: member names are unique
PASS PerformanceEventTiming interface: existence and properties of interface object
PASS PerformanceEventTiming interface object length
PASS PerformanceEventTiming interface object name
PASS PerformanceEventTiming interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object
PASS PerformanceEventTiming interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object's "constructor" property
PASS PerformanceEventTiming interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object's @@unscopables property
PASS PerformanceEventTiming interface: attribute processingStart

PASS EventCounts interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object's "constructor" property
PASS EventCounts interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object's @@unscopables property
PASS EventCounts interface: maplike<DOMString, unsigned long long>
PASS EventCounts must be primary interface of performance.eventCounts
PASS Stringification of performance.eventCounts
PASS Performance interface: attribute eventCounts
FAIL Performance interface: attribute interactionCount assert_true: The prototype object must have a property "interactionCount" expected true got false
PASS Performance interface: performance must inherit property "eventCounts" with the proper type
FAIL Performance interface: performance must inherit property "interactionCount" with the proper type assert_inherits: property "interactionCount" not found in prototype chain
Harness: the test ran to completion.
