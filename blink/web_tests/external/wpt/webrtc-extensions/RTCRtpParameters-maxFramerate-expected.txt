This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS addTransceiver() with sendEncoding.maxFramerate field set to less than 0 should reject with RangeError
FAIL addTransceiver('audio') with sendEncoding.maxFramerate should succeed, but remove the maxFramerate, even if it is invalid Failed to execute 'addTransceiver' on 'RTCPeerConnection': Attempted to set RtpParameters max_framerate to an invalid value. max_framerate must be >= 0.0
FAIL setParameters with maxFramerate on an audio sender should succeed, but remove the maxFramerate assert_equals: expected 1 but got 0
FAIL setParameters with an invalid maxFramerate on an audio sender should succeed, but remove the maxFramerate assert_equals: expected 1 but got 0
PASS setParameters() with encoding.maxFramerate field set to less than 0 should reject with RangeError
PASS setParameters() with maxFramerate 24->16 should succeed with RTCRtpTransceiverInit
PASS setParameters() with maxFramerate 24->16 should succeed without RTCRtpTransceiverInit
PASS setParameters() with maxFramerate undefined->16 should succeed with RTCRtpTransceiverInit
PASS setParameters() with maxFramerate undefined->16 should succeed without RTCRtpTransceiverInit
PASS setParameters() with maxFramerate 24->undefined should succeed with RTCRtpTransceiverInit
PASS setParameters() with maxFramerate 24->undefined should succeed without RTCRtpTransceiverInit
PASS setParameters() with maxFramerate 0->16 should succeed with RTCRtpTransceiverInit
PASS setParameters() with maxFramerate 0->16 should succeed without RTCRtpTransceiverInit
PASS setParameters() with maxFramerate 24->0 should succeed with RTCRtpTransceiverInit
PASS setParameters() with maxFramerate 24->0 should succeed without RTCRtpTransceiverInit
Harness: the test ran to completion.
