// Specifies a quantization scheme for the data in a ComputePressureState.
//
// Each array of thresholds subdivides the interval [0.0, 1.0]. The array must
// not contain the 0.0 and 1.0 values, as they are implied. For example, the
// array {0.2, 0.5, 0.8} specifies the sub-intervals [0.0, 0.2], [0.2, 0.5],
// [0.5, 0.8], and [0.8, 1.0]. The thresholds in an array must be sorted.
//
// A value is quantized by replacing it with the center of the interval that it
// falls in. For example, a CPU utilization quantizing scheme that matches the
// example above would report a CPU utilization value of 0.51 as 0.65. This is
// because 0.51 falls in the sub-interval [0.5, 0.8], and the center of that
// interval is 0.65, the average of 0.5 and 0.8.
