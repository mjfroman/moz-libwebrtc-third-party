Description:
This library is the underlying pattern matching engine for the URLPattern web
API proposal being discussed in https://github.com/wicg/urlpattern.  It uses
a pattern syntax derived from the path-to-regexp library developed at
https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp.  It is developed by the chromium
project, but licensed as a derivative work of path-to-regexp using an MIT
license.  No code from path-to-regexp is directly used here.  Note, since this
is the authoritative source of this library the "local modifications" of this
README does not apply.
