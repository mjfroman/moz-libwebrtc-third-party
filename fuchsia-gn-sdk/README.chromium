Description:
This directory contains the files that complement the Fuchsia SDK
for projects that use the GN build tool. The files in src/ were originally
copied from https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/fuchsia/+/a1d52817323cccc0a393b232363e0f2278dec14c/scripts/sdk/gn/base/build/.
Note that the file `enable_coverage_data.cml` is not included in the copy
since this file will be replaced by a file in the core SDK.
