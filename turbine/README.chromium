Description:
Turbine is a header compiler for Java. This library does not provide versioning
or maven releases, so we need to pull it in and build it ourselves.

Since we have no working non-android java proto processor, we cannot yet build
it in GN, so we are using a prebuilt jar encapsulating all of its dependencies.

Update Instructions:
* Find the latest instance from:
  https://chrome-infra-packages.appspot.com/p/chromium/third_party/turbine/+/
  * These instances are uploaded by the build bot:
    https://ci.chromium.org/p/chromium/builders/ci/3pp-linux-amd64-packager
    * The bot autoruns every 6 hours. Ping a trooper or a clank build core dev to
      trigger it if you need it sooner:
      https://luci-scheduler.appspot.com/jobs/chromium/3pp-linux-amd64-packager
* Copy this instance ID to the turbine entry in //DEPS.
