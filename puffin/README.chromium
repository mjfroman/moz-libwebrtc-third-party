Description:
Puffin is a deterministic deflate recompressor. It is mainly used for patching
deflate compressed images (zip, gzip, etc.) because patches created from deflate
files/streams are usually large (deflate has a bit-aligned format, hence,
changing one byte in the raw data can cause the entire deflate stream to change
drastically.) Specifically in chromium/src, this library is needed in order for
Omaha, chrome's auto-updater client, to support puffin-generated diffs created
by Omaha Server.

Local Modifications:
- Updated OWNERS to reflect the chromium/src owners and inherit the original AOSP owners as well.
- Removed BUILD.gn taken from AOSP as it doesn't build in chromium.
- removed PRESUBMIT.cfg and PREUPLOAD.cfg
- Adding a DEPS file so we can pass presubmit checks.
